## Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of Artifical Intelligence which gives machines the ability to learn from the data. In recent times it has gained enormous popularity due to some cool and hot applications. Nowadays Machine Learning is excessively used almost everywhere whether it is Predicting the Stock Prices, Forecasting the Weather, Medical Image Processing, Advertisement, etc.
Machine Learning algorithms are basically mathematical models which learn some underlying pattern of the data(called training data) and make predictions on unseen data (called test data) without being explicitly programmed.

#### Classification of Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a vast field which deals with different kind of problems based on the kind of problem it solves Machine Learning is classified into three major categories.
##### 1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, our algorithm learns the underlying pattern of the data in the presence of a supervisor called label. To understand the above let's take an example.
X &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y
13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.5
1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3
2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.4
5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3
If we  say what will be value of Y when X = 6.5 ?
Here we can see that X and their respective label Y is given which acts as supervisor (later we will see how), that's why such kind of learning is called supervised learning.

Supervised learning is classified into two categories:
- Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category or class such as gender(male, female), yes/no, etc.
- Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as price, cost, etc.
Later we will dive deeper into this.

##### 1. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning is a type of learning in which the machine learning model learns the underlying pattern of the data without the help of pre-existing labels.
In the above problem (see supervised learning). If Y is not given then it will be called unsupervised learning problem.

Unsupervised learning is classified into two categories.
- Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.
- Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.

##### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a powerful machine learning technique which deals with skill acquisition based on the concept called action and reward. We can say that reinforcement learning is all about making a decision and learning from that decision. In a more sophisticated way, we can say that the output depends on the state of the current input and the next input depends on the output of the previous input.


##### Famous People About Machine Learning
- “Machine learning and deep learning will create a new set of hot jobs in the next 5 years.” ~Dave Waters
- “I predict that, because of artificial intelligence and its ability to automate certain tasks that in the past were impossible to automate, not only will we have a much wealthier civilization, but the quality of work will go up very significantly and a higher fraction of people will have callings and careers relative to today.” ~Jeff Bezos
- “I am telling you, the world’s first trillionaires are going to come from somebody who masters AI and all its derivatives, and applies it in ways we never thought of.” ~Mark Cuban
- “Predicting the future isn’t magic, it’s artificial intelligence.” ~Dave Waters
- “A baby learns to crawl, walk and then run.  We are in the crawling stage when it comes to applying machine learning.” ~Dave Waters

You can start learning Machine Learning right now right here and the good thing is it is absolutely free. But before you start you need to have following prerequisites
- Mathematics Skill- Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability and basics of Statistics.
- Programming Skill- We will provide code snippets in Python, so you must have basic programming skills in Python and some libraries mainly numpy for numerical computation, pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization. We also recommend you to learn how to use jupyter notebook.
- Courage and Patience.

We would be more than happy to assist you if you're having trouble with prerequisites.
