      title: 'An Optimized Dense Convolutional Neural Network Model for Disease Recognition and Classification in Corn Leaf',
      authors: 'Hari Mohan Pandey, Abdul Waheed, Muskan Goyal, Deepak Gupta, Ashish Khanna, Aboul ella Hassanien',

      abstract: 'An optimized dense convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture (DenseNet)'
      + 'for corn leaf disease recognition and classification is proposed in this paper. Corn is one of the'
      + 'most cultivated grain throughout the world. Corn crops are highly susceptible to certain leaf'
      + 'diseases such as corn common rust, corn gray leaf spot, and northern corn leaf blight are very'
      + 'common. Symptoms of these leaf diseases are not differentiable in their nascent stages. Hence,'
      + 'the current research presents a solution through deep learning so that crop health can be'
      + 'monitored and, it will lead to an increase in the quantity as well as the quality of crop'
      + 'production. The proposed optimized DenseNet model has achieved an accuracy of 98.06%.'
      + 'Besides, it uses significantly lesser parameters as compared to the various existing CNN such'
      + 'as EfficientNet, VGG19Net, NASNet, and Xception Net. The performance of the optimized'
      + 'DenseNet model has been contrasted with the current CNN architectures by considering two'
      + '(time and accuracy) quality measures. This study indicates that the performance of the'
      + 'optimized DenseNet model is close to that of the established CNN architectures with far fewer'
      + 'parameters and computation time.'
